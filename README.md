# Caesar Wheel Enc/decryptor Tool

##  **Description**

I developed a piece of software using python to solve the ciphers encrypted by Caesar wheel algorithm.<br />
The Caesar cipher is named after [Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar), to protect messages of military significance. Caesar's was the first recorded use of this scheme.<br />
The key to solve the cipher is the number of turns (Caesar usually used 3 turns as a key) in which you turn the outer ring n number of times then you will have a lookup table as a key.<br />
My software takes the number of turns, the message and returns the encrypted message
<br />
<br />

##  **About Caesar Wheel Method**
Caesar wheel algorithm encrypt the message in a quite simple way.<br />
imagine you have the 26 letters of english put in circuilar way, and the same letters are put in a larger circle, so for the letter "A" to face the "A" in the other wheel, the key to solve the encrypted message is the number of turns of one of the wheels.<br />
the picture below will give you a better intuition about the idea of working.

##  **How it works**
The UI takes both your message and the number of turns, and encrypt/decrypt your message.<br />
It also visualize the two wheels, so you can see which letter faces which.
